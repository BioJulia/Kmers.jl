    SpacedKmers{T,S}(seq::S, step::Int, start::Int, stop::Int) where {T<:Kmer,S<:BioSequence}

An iterator over every valid `T<:Kmer` separated by a `step` parameter, in a given
longer `BioSequence`, between a `start` and `stop` position.

!!! note
    Typically, the alphabet of the Kmer type matches the alphabet of the input
    BioSequence. In these cases, the iterator will have `Base.IteratorSize` of
    `Base.HasLength`, and successive kmers produced by the iterator will overlap
    by `max(0, K - step)` bases.
    
    However, in the specific case of iterating over kmers in a DNA or RNA sequence, you
    may iterate over a Kmers where the alphabet is a NucleicAcidAlphabet{2}, but
    the input BioSequence has a NucleicAcidAlphabet{4}.
    
    In this case then the iterator will skip over positions in the BioSequence
    with characters that are not supported by the Kmer type's NucleicAcidAlphabet{2}.
    
    As a result, the overlap between successive kmers may not consistent, but the
    reading frame will be preserved.
    In addition, the iterator will have `Base.IteratorSize` of `Base.SizeUnknown`.
